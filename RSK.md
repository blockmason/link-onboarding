## Using RSK with Blockmason Link
RSK is an open source, Ethereum compatible, Smart Contract platform secured by the Bitcoin Network. RSK adds value and expand functionality to the Bitcoin ecosystem by providing smart contracts and greater scalability.

In this onboarding example, we will deploy a smart contract to the RSK Testnet. 

### Setup
> You can obtain some testnet RBTC tokens from [RSK Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.rsk.co/) to be sent to your Link default account address:

### API project setup in Link
> 1. In Link, open up the setting dropdown menu and select *`New Project`* which starts the new project wizard.

![Link New Project](images/link_new_project.png)

> 2. Under *Which contract would you like to use?*, select `Ownership` if the contract already exists, or select *`Create new`* and then copy and paste the `Ownership.sol` code into the *Source Code* field. Set the *Display Name* as `Ownership`. Press *`Save`* and *`Next`*.

> 3. Under *Which Ethereum account would you like to use?*, use the *`Default Account`*. This is the account we seeded with test RBTC tokens as part of the setup.

> 4. Under *Which network would you like to use?*, select *`Create new`* and call it `RSK Testnet`. Keep the *Block Confirmations Needed* at 0. Press *`Save`* and *`Next`*.

> 5. Under *Which connector would you like to use?*, select *`Create new`*. Call this connector `RSK Testnet Connector` and use the URL `https://public-node.testnet.rsk.co` (see https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/wiki/rsk-public-nodes for more details). Ensure the *Network* selected is *`RSK Testnet`*. Press *`Save`* and *`Next`*.

> 6. Now we just need to label our Deployment. Under *Where is your contract deployed?*, select *`Create new`*. Call this deployment `Ownership RSK Testnet Deployment`. Since we do not have **an existing contract deployment**, leave the *Address* field blank. Ensure the *Account* is the `Default Account`, the *Contract* is the `Ownership` contract and the *Network* `RSK Testnet`. Press *`Save`* and *`Next`*.

> 7. Now we're ready to deploy our contract to the RSK Testnet. Press `Deploy` and you should get a deployment in progress indicator icon. This might take up to a minute to complete. If deployed correctly, you'll proceed to the next step to set up your API.

> **If you get a `failed-to-fetch` error after you have waited a minute, try to `Deploy` the contract again - you will likely see the contract is already deployed and at what address. If this is the case, simply press `Next` to continue the process.**

![Link Deployment Complete](images/rsk/link_deploy_complete.png)

> 8. Now we label our Ownership contract API. Under *Name*, call it *`ownership-rsk-testnet`* Also add in a human-readable display name. Ensure you are using the correct *Contract Deployment*. Press *`Save`* and *`Next`*.

![Link API New](images/rsk/link_api_setup.png)

> 9. Now we label our Ownership API **Consumer**. This would normally be the name of the app or service calling the API. For example, let's call the consumer `Collectible Stamps App`. Ensure you are using the correct *API* and *Account*. Press *`Save`* and *`Next`*.

![Link Consumer New](images/rsk/link_consumer_setup.png)

> 10. Lastly, your consumer needs to authenticate with the Ownership API. An OAuth2.0 Client Secret is automatically generated. Ensure you are using the correct Principal/Consumer. Press *`Save`*, *`Next`* and then *`Finish`*.

![Create new OAuth](images/oauth_link_new.png)

Once you hit *`Finish`*, you should end up back at Home page and see your Ownership code in the IDE, the API tab and a gear icon containing the `client_id` and `client_secret` at the bottom of the page which you will use in your app.

Let's also check that our Ownership contract deployed correctly on the RSK Testnet. Click on the `Ethereum Contract Deployments` menu item to see a list of contract deployments and their addresses. Copy and paste the address of the `Ownership RSK Testnet Deployment` into the RSK Testnet explorer https://explorer.testnet.rsk.co/ to see the details of your contract deployment.

![Link Contract Deployments List](images/rsk/link_contracts_deployed_list.png)

In the above example, the contract address on the RSK network is `0xa187da3f23129e03904d1ad4a44062970b898e22`.

And we see our contract deployed on RSK!

Now you can go ahead and use the API endpoints which are linked to the Ownership smart contract deployed on RSK Testnet!

### Test Ownership API endpoints
A simple JavaScript file using the Link JavaScript SDK in a Node environment can be found here:

https://github.com/blockmason/link-onboarding/blob/master/ownership-link-sdk-demo.js

> First, run `npm install` from your Terminal to install the `node-fetch` and `@blockmason/link-sdk` dependencies (see `package.json`).

> Then, in `ownership-link-sdk-demo.js`, update the `clientID` and `clientSecret` for authentication.

 > Finally run the `ownership-link-sdk-demo.js` script using Node from the Terminal. You should see an output in Terminal similar to the following:

 ![Ownership Script Example](images/rsk/ownership_sdk_example.png)

 > Check your Ownership contract using the RSK Testnet Explorer to confirm the new transactions representing the `setOwner()` and `getOwner()` function calls. 

### Deploying to RSK Mainnet

If you want to deploy on the RSK Mainnet, just follow the same steps above with the following differences:
  > 1. Acquire mainnet RBTC tokens to send to your Link default account wallet
  
  > 2. Use the use the appropriate [RSK Network public nodes RPC URL](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/wiki/rsk-public-nodes) for Mainnet.
